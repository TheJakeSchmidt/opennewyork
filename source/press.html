<li> Curbed - <a href=https://ny.curbed.com/2018/9/17/17869546/open-new-york-yimby-rezoning-brooklyn-nimby">The YIMBY movement comes to New York City</a> - Sept 2018
<blockquote>Open New York, formerly More New York, began in earnest in 2017. Having grown tired of what they regard as the one-sided nature of land use politics in New York (a developer will propose a city-backed project, neighborhood groups vehemently oppose it), Open New York seeks to add a pro-development perspective to the anti-development chorus that often commandeers housing debates.

<blockquote>Department of Housing Preservation and Development Commissioner Maria Torres-Springer weighed in on burgeoning pro-development activism on Wednesday, saying there's "good news" in the Yes In My Backyard, or YIMBY, movements that have popped up in varying degrees in cities around the country.

<blockquote>New York’s severe housing crisis can be traced to a simple fact—our city doesn’t have enough homes for the people who want to live here.

</a> - May 2018
<blockquote>
	This outcome wasn’t a surprise. Brooklyn Community Board 2 voted overwhelmingly last night to oppose the proposed rezoning of the 80 Flatbush development site, which would allow for a near tripling of the density on the block bordered by Flatbush and Third avenues and State and Schermerhorn streets.
	<br/>...<br/>
	Several representatives of Open New York (a reported 30 active members) made the not unreasonable argument that New York City needs more housing, that sites near transit can best absorb it, and that wealthier communities should accept their fair share, partly to reduce the pressure of gentrification deeper in Brooklyn.

<blockquote>A proposal for a massive downtown Brooklyn development that would include a huge high rise has been met with significant community opposition. That's pretty much expected.
<br/><br/>
But this familiar scenario has an unusual twist — the project, known as 80 Flatbush, also has a good deal of grass-roots support, and backers are making some headway....

">Inside the Battle over the Megaproject at 80 Flatbush</a> - April 2018
<blockquote>
	Opponents of the two-tower 80 Flatbush project call it “a Chrysler Building in Brownstone Brooklyn.” Its developers and supporters see it differently, believing that its size is a virtue, providing room for a wealth of facilities including two schools, office space and 200 units of affordable housing.
