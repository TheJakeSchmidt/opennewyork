               <strong>ABOUT THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR POSITION</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
               The executive director will be Open New York's first full-time position,
               and will be responsible for overseeing the group's administration,
               programs, and strategic plan. Other key duties include fundraising,
               political engagement, and community and new member outreach. This is a full
               time, exempt position. The executive director reports directly to the Open
               New York board of directors.
            </p>
            <p>
               <strong>ABOUT OPEN NEW YORK</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
               Founded in 2016, Open New York is (until now!) a volunteer-led pro-housing
               organization. We believe that New York City's housing crisis is
               fundamentally driven by a shortage of housing, driven by exclusionary
               zoning. We advocate for equitable development that expands all housing
               options for New Yorkers, including both affordable and market rate housing.
            </p>
            <p>
               While New York was late to the national YIMBY (yes in my backyard)
               movement, we have had some major successes in the past few years, and are
               looking for an executive director to build on those accomplishments. Thus
               far, we have supported the development of mixed-income housing by showing
               up to public meetings, speaking to elected officials, and built coalitions
               with diverse partners. We started out supporting individual projects, and
               have been moving on to bigger battles at the neighborhood-wide level. This
               past year, we forced the city to change course on a rezoning to allow
               mixed-income housing in SoHo and NoHo. We have built a coalition and
               succeeded in getting the mayor, multiple mayoral candidates, and the
               primary local council member on board.
            </p>
            <p>
               While we will continue to support individual projects, we want to broaden
               our impact by pushing for reforms beyond the level of individual projects.
               We aspire to be active across all five boroughs, where we will make new
               allies who reflect New York City’s spectacular diversity. Ultimately, we
               see coalition-building extending beyond New York City to the suburbs to
               push for land use reform at the state level.
            </p>
            <p>
               <strong>QUALIFICATIONS &amp; ATTRIBUTES</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
               We are looking for candidates with a proven track record in community
               organizing, fundraising, and political engagement. Open New York believes
               that level of education and credentials do not indicate who is best
               equipped to fight for New Yorkers and housing. All interested people are
               welcome to apply.
            </p>
            <p>
               As the first Open New York hire, this is a greenfield position. You will
               have to be invested in building an organization. You will have a high
               degree of autonomy and freedom to set up novel structures to propel the
               organization into a new era of greater impact. We have a committed base of
               volunteers and board members ready and willing to help and take direction.
            </p>
            <p>
               We are looking for someone who is passionate about housing, and isn’t shy
               about delegating work to volunteers. We want an executive director who can
               build bridges with other organizations, and who can ruthlessly prioritize
               among work tasks (there is a lot to do but we want you to have a life
               outside of work). You should know New York City – its neighborhoods, its
               politics, and its diversity – but also know something about how the YIMBY
               movement has succeeded (and failed) elsewhere, or be committed to learning.
               You should be comfortable working with audiences both technical and
               non-technical, political and apolitical, and the full range of stakeholders
               in the land use process.
            </p>

               Fluency in Spanish or other languages is a plus, as is demonstrated
               experience with public engagement.
